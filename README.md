## Done
        *two sum
        *three sum
        *two sum index
        *del same ele in a sorted array. and can set the max of duplication.



## Thoughts
        *convert
        >del elements when count exceed max can convert to del all same only keep one just by adjusting the min compare step number.
        why? still confused.
