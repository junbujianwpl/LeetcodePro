## Done
        * two sum
        * three sum
        * two sum index
        * del same ele in a sorted array. and can set the max of duplication.



## Thoughts
        * convert
        > del elements when count exceed max can convert to del all same only keep one just by adjusting the min compare step number.
        why? still confused.
        how to get the common law and extract the thinking style.
